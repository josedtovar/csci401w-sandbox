## Product Vision

- **Product Vision Statement:** Redefining education with personalized tutoring powered by AI. Tailored to each student's needs and adaptable to educators' preferences, and empowering teachers with the tools to guide their pupils.

## Learning and Growth Journey

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   -Our team primarily leveraged Microsoft Teams for direct communication and scheduling meetings. We found that by utilizing channels within Teams, we could effectively coordinate tasks and manage projects.
   -For example, during our weekly meetings, we would outline project milestones and assign tasks directly within Teams. Each milestone was broken down into actionable steps, with team members assigned specific responsibilities. This approach allowed us to maintain clarity and accountability within our projects.
   Assigning and informing eachother when we were working on our Github via Teams turned out to be critically important to making sure we would not do overlapping work. We could easily track progress, ask questions, and provide updates to eachother fostering effective communication without the need for multiple tools.
   -Overall, our reliance on Microsoft Teams for task coordination and project management proved to be efficient and effective, allowing us to stay organized and productive throughout our collaboration.

2. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   An issue we experienced early on in our project was working on the same sections of code at the same time. This created issues when trying to push our code to GitHub. Our team overcame this by creating a groupchat where we would tell eachother when we began working on a part of our code letting eachother know what we were working on and when we were committing it. Additionally to this we began to utilize branches which paired with out greater communications greatly reduced our run in with this issue.

3. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   Highlight a feature you contributed to, such as creating a login system. Discuss how your combined skills enabled the team to deliver a functional feature that enhances user experience.

4. **Learning and Growth:**
Learning about different aspects of Git and the Agile approach to software development were essential in our process. By meeting weekly we were able to pivot the goal of our project, multiple times. Initially planning to make our chatbot more personalized to students, it became more of a tool to allow Teachers to offer and control AI usage of their students. Learning about Git also was a large aspect of our project, utilizing branches, commits, pull requests, and merging branches.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

SmartLearnChat is a AI chatbot that allows teachers to give students access to AI in the classroom safely while also being able to limit access to only students. Secure development allows teachers and students alike to use this software without any concern over their online safety.

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Example 1:** Demonstrate how users can browse product categories using a straightforward navigation bar.
- **Example 2:** Showcase how your cybersecurity-focused feature detects and alerts users about potentially harmful links.

### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example:** Explain the client-server architecture by comparing it to a waiter taking orders (client) and a kitchen preparing food (server).

### Codebase Exploration

Illustrate a coding concept with a relatable analogy:

- **Example:** Describe a conditional statement (like an "if" statement) as a recipe that's followed only if certain conditions, like having all ingredients, are met.

### Access Your Work

- **[Presentation Slides](link-to-presentation):** Share a link to your final presentation slides.
- **[Source Code Repository](link-to-repo):** (https://github.com/josedtovar/csci401w-sandbox/tree/main)
- **Other Materials:** Include links to diagrams or documents you created for your project.

## Final Reflection Presentation

- **Duration:** 25-minute minimum, 40-minute maximum

## Career Readiness Assessment

Answer the following questions with practical examples:

1. **Team Collaboration Skills:*

Consistently meeting every week as well as when any of us needed help allowed us to collaborate more effectively. Using teams as a commincation platform greatly improved our workflow. - Giovani

2. **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Share a situation where you had to troubleshoot a technical issue and how you approached the problem-solving process.

A technical issue I had early in development was getting all the pieces of the MERN stack working together correctly as well as issues with vscode and GitHub. I restarted the project multiple times due to things breaking and not being able to figure out how to fix them. I solved these problems by using online resources which explained how it is supposed to work. - Giovani
   
4. **Contributions to the Project:** Discuss a specific task you contributed to and how your involvement positively impacted the project's development.

I contributed to some initial setup for the MERN stack but mostly spent time on frontend development. I think my involvlment helped to add a dynamic and colorful UI which positively impacts the look of our project. - Giovani

4. **Applied Knowledge:** Describe a technical concept learned in class that you've used in your project, highlighting its practical relevance.


  
5. **Adaptability and Learning:** Provide an example of a challenge you faced that required learning a new skill or concept, and how you adapted to overcome it.

The entire process of building a fullstack application was new to me and so the entire concept had to be learned. I adapted to this by watching many vidoes on using MERN stack and how each part of the stack works together. - Giovani
