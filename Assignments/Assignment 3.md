## Directions:

This assignment is designed to guide you in understanding the foundational aspects of your project. Remember, in software engineering, understanding the "why" behind decisions is often as important as the decisions themselves. As you navigate these early stages of your coding journey, focus on grasping the core reasons behind each choice, and use this document to record and reflect on those reasons.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose

This document describes the archeticture of our MERN Stack Project

---

## 2. System Overview

Provide a simple diagram or description of the high-level system.

---

## 3. Technical Choices

### 3.1. Frontend Framework

HTML, JavaScript, CSS with Elastic UI / React

### 3.2. Backend Framework

NodeJs / Express

### 3.3. Database System

MongoDB / Json format

---

## 4. Other Considerations
AWS / ChatBot

### 4.1. Team Skills and Learning

Learning the knowledge base Chatbot implementation and documention.
Learn about AI and machine learning
Learn MERN stack development
How to pull in Github

### 4.2. Community and Support

Yes, There are a lot of Youtube videos and FreecodeCamp tutorials for MERN stack development.

### 4.3. Future Adaptability

A MERN stack is an industry standard for developmenting websites. It will be easy to push it into a cloud based system.

## 5. Decision Log

Here, you'll log key decisions made and the rationale behind them. Here's an example:

| Date       | Decision                                 | Reasoning                                                                                                           |
|------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 2024-03-03 | Chose React as a frontend framework to use Elastic UI  | The Elastic UI has an abundance of frontend library to use for a dynamic website |

| 2024-03-03 | Chose MongoDb as a database | MongoDB is a free cloud community server data base that is easy to implement and uses JSON formatting. |

Note: As you progress, keep adding to this log. It will not only help you track your decisions but also offer insights into your evolving
