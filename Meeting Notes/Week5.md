### 🗒️ Notes:
- Achitecture: MERN stack.
    - MERN is a JavaScript Stack used for full-stack web applications
    - Comprised of four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js
- We will most like utilize OpenAI for our ChatBot. 
    - Assistant API is in beta but seems promising.
- Discussed the idea of using a bot builder - like botpress - to create our chat bot.
    - This would take some pressure off of us while still utilizing OpenAI.
    - Allows for creation of Knowledge Base and offers many tutorials.
    - We will do more research and make a decision at next weeks meeting.
- FreeCodeCamp will also be used as a resource by the group. We discussed the idea of assigning FreeCodeCamp work each week.
- Next week, we will develop a diagram or description of the high-level system.
