### 🎯 Meeting Objectives:
Discuss feedback on assignment 3
Breakdown the steps to build an AI Chatbot 
Decide as a group what other decisions need to be made for us to begin working on our project. 

### 🗒️ Notes:

- The group discussed the AI Chatbot in greater depth.
      - We outlined a few possible ways to develop the Chatbot, each with a different degree of time-commitment and skill.For example, Botpress no-code builder vs. Hugging Face open-source pretrained model. Because these concepts are new to us, we will first try to build our own chatbot.
  - We will utilize Python, with TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries, a pretrained model from Hugging Face library, and an API. 
                  - If this proves to be too much of a challenge, we can resort to options that better fit our skill level. 
      - We will need to develop the dataset. This will most likely be in JSON format (could be a database). We discussed the option of building our own dataset or utilizing an opensource dataset. Due to the specific nature of our Chatbot knowledgebase, we will be building our own dataset.
      - We will need to develop an API for user queries. 

- There were a few feedback suggestions we didn't feel quite confident enough to act on this meeting (ex. state management in React or the plan to structure our data).
   - We will research these topics over the next week. 

- Another piece of feedback we want to act upon is documenting decisions we have deferred for future consideration and using our Github repository as a living document.
